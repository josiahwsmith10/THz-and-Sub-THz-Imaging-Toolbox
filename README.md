# THz-and-Sub-THz-Imaging-Toolbox
A toolbox for near-field THz imaging simulation and image reconstruction.
This toolbox enables rapid development of near-field THz imaging radar systems by providing easy access to efficient simulation tools and diverse toolset with documented API. Additionally, the toolbox provides efficient generation of large near-field THz imaging scenarios useful for many data-driven applications.

- This toolbox includes algorithms for computing SAR images from irregular geometries. Demos for doing so can be found in the repository: [Efficient 3-D Near-Field MIMO-SAR Imaging for Irregular Scanning Geometries](https://github.com/josiahwsmith10/Efficient-3-D-Near-Field-MIMO-SAR-Imaging-for-Irregular-Scanning-Geometries), which follows our paper ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02064), [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3145370)) with the same title.
