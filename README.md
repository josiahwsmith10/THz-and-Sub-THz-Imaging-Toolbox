# THz-and-Sub-THz-Imaging-Toolbox
A toolbox for near-field THz imaging simulation and image reconstruction.
This toolbox enables rapid development of near-field THz imaging radar systems by providing easy access to efficient simulation tools and diverse toolset with documented API. Additionally, the toolbox provides efficient generation of large near-field THz imaging scenarios useful for many data-driven applications.
